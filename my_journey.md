# My Journey

- This homework was tough — I only managed to finish it across three separate sessions. Each session focused on a different part: understanding the algorithms, writing the code, and testing/fixing bugs.

- One night my classes ran late and I could only work on the assignment for about an hour before I fell asleep — that slowed me down a bit, but I kept going the next day.

## What I learned
- Putting Boyer–Moore's bad-character and good-suffix pieces together is trickier than it looks.
- KMP, Rabin–Karp and Boyer–Moore each shine in different situations — testing helped me see those trade-offs.
- Building a small pre-analysis that picks an algorithm based on simple features made the whole thing more reliable.

## Biggest challenges
- Getting the good-suffix preprocessing correct and handling edge cases (empty pattern, pattern > text, Unicode).
- Balancing correctness with performance and keeping the pre-analysis cheap.

## Feedback
- The assignment is great for learning, but more small examples and step-by-step walkthroughs for the tricky preprocessing parts would help future students.

## Final note

- I learned a lot doing this. It was frustrating at times, but also rewarding — I can see where to improve the code and the approach next time.

- I wrote what I did for the homework in the REPORT.md file.
